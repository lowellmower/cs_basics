# a heap is an abstract data structure similar to that of
# a binary search tree. Like a BST, a heap is a collection
# of nodes that have a data member value and at most, two
# child nodes. The differentiating factor is that nodes in
# a heap satisfy the heap property:
# e.g. when p.value >= n.value for each child node n of a
# parent p - - this example would be considered a max heap
# EXAMPLE:
#        5
#       / \
#      4   3
# a min heap would be a heap where in a parent p never
# exceeds the values of a child node n. This would be
# known as a min heap
# EXAMPLE:
#          3
#        /   \
#       10    4
#      / \   / \
#     13 11 5   8
# note that the root in a min heap has the smallest value
# in the data structure and the root in a max heap is the
# opposite, e.g. the larget value in the data structure
